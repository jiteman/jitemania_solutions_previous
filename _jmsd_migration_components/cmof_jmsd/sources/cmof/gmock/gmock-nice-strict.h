// Implements class templates NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock.
//
// Given a mock class MockFoo that is created using Google Mock,
// NiceMock<MockFoo> is a subclass of MockFoo that allows
// uninteresting calls (i.e. calls to mock methods that have no
// EXPECT_CALL specs), NaggyMock<MockFoo> is a subclass of MockFoo
// that prints a warning when an uninteresting call occurs, and
// StrictMock<MockFoo> is a subclass of MockFoo that treats all
// uninteresting calls as errors.
//
// Currently a mock is naggy by default, so MockFoo and
// NaggyMock<MockFoo> behave like the same.  However, we will soon
// switch the default behavior of mocks to be nice, as that in general
// leads to more maintainable tests.  When that happens, MockFoo will
// stop behaving like NaggyMock<MockFoo> and start behaving like
// NiceMock<MockFoo>.
//
// NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock "inherit" the constructors of
// their respective base class.  Therefore you can write
// NiceMock<MockFoo>(5, "a") to construct a nice mock where MockFoo
// has a constructor that accepts (int, const char*), for example.
//
// A known limitation is that NiceMock<MockFoo>, NaggyMock<MockFoo>,
// and StrictMock<MockFoo> only works for mock methods defined using
// the MOCK_METHOD* family of macros DIRECTLY in the MockFoo class.
// If a mock method is defined in a base class of MockFoo, the "nice"
// or "strict" modifier may not affect it, depending on the compiler.
// In particular, nesting NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock is NOT
// supported.
