Maintain the codebase:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update the codebase:
	Complex:
		change method and way of Environments' initialization
			@ add native shared and weak (or use ::std versions)
			+ native_Reference_counters
			* native_Object_with_reference_counters
				delete reference counters if total counter reached nil
				delete object if shared reference counter reached nil
				empty object if shared reference counter is nil
				increase shared reference counter if copied as shared
				decrease shared reference counter if destroyed as shared
				increase weak reference counter if copied as weak
				decrease weak reference counter if destroyed as weak
				
		move all native stuff to encodebuba
			? rename encodebuba -> jmsf_native
			+ create jmsf_native_Should_ based on jmsf_Should_
			+ create native_File_and_line			
			
		console, debug [msvc|qt-creator] CULE output
			@ ms_windows project transform to al_windows
			al_qt project
						
AVL-tree:	
	* remove method (? deleting this node)
		preserve all other nodes
	? imprecise find: do we need closest values if exact match found
	
AVL-tree traverser:
	? remove take_node() and get_node() methods
		add reference to the tree
	not traversing out of tree structure
	traversing in order of storing
	traversing in order of objects
	different traversers
	? unprecise find (nearest/closest values (up|down))
	move_(previous/next) for traverser

TAVL-tree:
	get previous object (TAVL)
	get next object (TAVL)

TAVL-tree traverser:
	move_(previous/next)_traversed for traverser
